## Introduction

HUAWEI HiHealth is a platform catering specifically to smart wearable devices and health & fitness services. After obtaining permissions from users, developers can integrate fitness capabilities and services into their products. The platform also aims to work with partners to facilitate service innovation, and provide users with highly-customized services.
App developers can integrate the HiHealthKit SDK into their apps, so that the apps can invoke the Java API (IF3) provided by HiHealthKit. After being authorized by users, these apps can then obtain user data from the HUAWEI Health app, or write the app data to the HUAWEI Health app. HUAWEI HiHealth allows apps to share data securely (on the device-side only), and integrates data from multiple apps, enabling users to access more considerate, secure, and professional services, at will.
HUAWEI HiHealth does not share data without authorization, and users can cancel the authorization, or delete the third-party data written into the HUAWEI HiHealth open platform, at any time. The following diagram shows the interactions that occur when the app requests user authorization.
